# gcmodeldev-cmor-tables
Prototype set of MIP tables that are being used for experimentation with CMORising HadGEM3 GC model data

These tables are adapted from those put together for CMIP6, but are primarily intended for experimentation with using CDDS for Met Office Model Development runs

New users wanting to add to the list of experiments, models, projects (MIPs referred to by an activity id) or variables should either start a discussion or contact cdds@metoffice.gov.uk for advice. Specific issues, e.g. "Please add experiment X to project Y", can be opened as issues.
